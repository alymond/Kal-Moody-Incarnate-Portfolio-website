        My name is Kal
    </h1>
    <p>
        I'm Kal, I started drawing after I saw my aunt doodle on her sketch pad and I asked her to teach me. I've always somehow been in art growing up, but I've only started to seriously work on it during the pandemic. I'm still in school and hoping to not die while working :>
